Skelepico Theme is a bare-bones theme for Pico CMS created on the Skeleton framework. It uses exclusively elements from Skeleton except for these features that I've added:

## Skelepico Theme 1.0.0
+ Added a sticky responsive navigation bar (coded exclusively in HTML/CSS)*
+ Added footer styles (to make credits look nicer)*
+ Added Skeleton's normalize.css code to the begining of the skeleton.css file and minified the code. This gives an extra point for Google PageSpeed score.
+ No validation errors here: https://validator.w3.org/nu/

*An asterisk indicates a design feature that can be removed by clearing the code from the custom.css file.*

## Theme Notes

The `base.twig` template is full width but you can still add your own columns using HTML in the `.md` files (this page uses the base template). `index.twig` and `page.twig` are also full width and ready for your customizations.

**This theme comes with demo content in the `.twig` templates. You will need to make adjustments accordingly!**

### Notes from Jon Beckett's (https://github.com/jonbeckett) code:

+ If you want to make a blog, create a folder within `/content`, and put your posts in it (purely to keep them organised - they are actually picked up by the blog page by having dates). For each post, use the template "post", and make sure they have a date metadata property. Then make a content file in the root of `/content` with the template "blog", and it will list all pages it finds that have a date in their metadata, in reverse order.
+ The blog template has Disqus built-in. If you want to use it, add `$config["disqus"]="username";` to the config file, and use the "post" template for blog posts.
+ The base theme has Google Analytics built-in. If you want to use it, add `$config["google-analytics"]="property_id";` to the config file.
